## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software development. Understanding these concepts can help you write more efficient and optimized code. This repository documents my journey as I delve deeper into these topics using C++.

## Why Learn Data Structures and Algorithms

- **Problem Solving:** Enhance your problem-solving skills by understanding how to tackle complex computational problems.
- **Efficiency:** Learn how to write code that is not only correct but also efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
- **Interviews:** Many technical interviews focus heavily on data structures and algorithms. This knowledge is essential for cracking coding interviews at top tech companies.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basic Data Structures**
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Hash Tables
    - Trees
    - Graphs

2. **Algorithms**
    - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
    - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Recursion
    - Greedy Algorithms
    - Divide and Conquer

3. **Advanced Topics**
    - Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*, etc.)
    - Advanced Tree Structures (AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.)
    - String Algorithms (KMP, Rabin-Karp, etc.)
    - Computational Geometry

## Environment Setup

To run the C++ code in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Here are some steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install a C++ Compiler**
    - For Windows: Install MinGW.
    - For macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools.
    - For Linux: Install `g++` using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install g++`).

2. **Install an IDE or Text Editor**
    - Visual Studio Code
    - CLion
    - Code::Blocks
    - Eclipse
    - Any other text editor or IDE of your choice.
